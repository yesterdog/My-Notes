NASA's Artemis program is set up with a mission to re-send humans to the moon [ยง]. To capture the images and vidoes of moon while they are there, NASA partnered with Nikon to develop a modified version of Nikon's Z9 camera; this is going to become the moon camera of the 21st century. Known internally at NASA as HULC (pronounced as HULK, I guess), it stands for Handheld Universal Lunar Camera. Here's more:

- Back when astronauts first went to the moon, cameras were attached to their suits and they had to use a separate camera for video shooting. This time they will be holding the camera the Earth way and are also going to shoot images and video with the same camera.

- The Artemis mission will take astronauts to the South Pole region of the moon where temperatures range anywhere from -200ยบ to 120ยบ Celsius, in addition to harmful radiation and dust. NASA designed a thermal jacket to wrap around HULC to withstand such harsh conditions.

- The thermal jacket is in itself an innovation; it is made up of Mylar (aluminized polyester film), Kevlar (material used to make bullet-proof vests), and Ortho-dust (blend of Nomex/Teflon/Kevlar).

- NASA had to come up with a custom grip and modified operations to allow camera operation even when astronauts are using thick gloves; the grip will connect to the camera via the 10-pin terminal.

- Nikon had to make firmware changes to accommodate 10-pin connection, changes to file naming sequence, default settings, shutter shield optimization, and power-consumption optimizations.

- To simulate extreme conditions, the camera is put to use in the darkness of volcanic caves. Although it was not disclosed anywhere, NASA's grants show an allocation of $381,081 to Nikon for the purpose of developing HULC.



ยง. One can only wish, but, if we are really lucky, we may even see the entire moon sojourn live broacast via Starlink.
