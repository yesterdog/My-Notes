Hyperscalers(data centers with 5,000 servers and occupying atleast 10k sq.m.) have democratized scalable cloud services to millions of users. The current AI summer demands construction of GPU stuffed large power-hungry hyperscalers. Since generation of electricity cannot happen at the same pace as GPU-compute gains, industry started looking for ways to optimize electricity usage. Here's more about how two companies—Winwynn and Liquid Stack—are building data centeres equipped with the world's most advanced data center cooling system known as immersion cooling:


– All the electricity consumed by hyperscalers does not go into compute needs. A sizeable chunk of it goes into controlling temparatures inside a datacenter. This is why environmentally conscious raise their eyebrows when they hear about the electricity demands from large datacenters.

– A data center's efficiency is measured using PUE (power usage effectiveness). PUE = energey delivered to data centers/energy consumed by the ICT devices. Lower PUE indicates efficient usage of electric energy. For example: a PUE of 1 is ideal, which means all the power is used directly by devices with none wasted on cooling or other purpose.

– Mechanical cooling is the least efficient among cooling methods. Alternatives include adiabatic cooling and direct evaporative cooling (DEC), both of which use advanced water humidification techniques to cool down the hot air before sending it back. Free-air-cooling works by pulling cold air from out side when the external temparatures are low; efficient as it may be, it's not fully reliable. Azure's hyperscalers use a mix of adiabatic, DEC and free-air-cooling.

– However innovative these techniques may be, immersion cooling systems beat all the other techniques with the best PUE ratio in the category; it is as low as 1.03 to 1.05. Immersion colling can easily handle high chip wattages(for AI and HPC), which are expected to exceed 1KW by 2026, all of which translates to a savings of $3.5M per 1MW.

– The way immersion cooling works is by submerging(yes, dipping and soaking) equipment in dielectric fluid immersion-cooling-tank. The dielectric fluid is maintained at its boiling point with the servers normal operations. A cyclic process to control heat generated from devices works in two phases: vapor from equipment heats and hits the condenser, followed by which condensor cools the vapor and sends the liquid back to the tank.

– Immersion-cooling-tank is managed and controlled by Universal Management SystemI(UMS) For Servers and Cooling Units.The UMS not only controls the overall tank but also monitors individual racks for leaks and optimizes energy use.

– Wiwynn operates in what is known as ODM(Original Design Manufacturing) market. They design, manufacture, and deliver cloud infrastructure products such as servers, storage and networking equipments, which allows cloud service providers like AWS, Azure etc. to sell cloud services to anyone. 

– Wiwynn partnered with Liquid Stack to install immersion cooling system in the newly built hyperscalers. Wiwynn invested $10M in Liquid Stack's series A funding round for a strategic partnership. This bet probably paid off very well for Wiwynn when it showed a growth of 97.5% growth YoY in its Q4 report in December, which would not have been possible if not for Liquid Stack's technology.

– Some companies known to be using Winwynn's Liquid Stack immersion-cooling-tank-system for their data centers are: Nvidia for its Blackwell chips, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon.
