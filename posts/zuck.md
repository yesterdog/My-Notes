Zuck ~revamped~ overhauled Facebook's moderation policy yesterday. Some interesting things from his announcement:

— Manual fact-checking did more damage than good, basically interferred with free speech
— Community notes(like X) is going to replace manual review team
— Content moderation team is going to be relocated to Texas
— No more bowing down to nation-states requests to takedown posts
— Apparently past administration interferred with free speech rights and made doing business harder
— There is some vile content in there but they are only going to censor highly-severe violations and is going to depend people feedback for moderately-bad content
- Civic content(including policital content) recommendation is back
- And called out Eurpoe for instituitonalizinx
