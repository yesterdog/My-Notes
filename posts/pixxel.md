Low Earth orbit (colloquially known as LEO) is an altitude above 100 km above the Earth's surface but under 2,000 km. LEO is home to, among other things, the ISS, Hubble Telescope, Starlink, and various Earth monitoring satellites. Pixxel, a five-year-old startup with offices in Bengaluru, launched the first three satellites of the Firefly constellation into low Earth orbit (LEO) last week via SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission, with three more planned for launch. This is a significant achievement for Pixxel and for the space community in general:

— Pixxel launched what are known as hyperspectral imaging (HSI for short) satellites for Earth monitoring. A network of satellites is planned to be stationed in LEO; since it takes about 128 minutes for each satellite to orbit around Earth, a group of satellites can capture voluminous data on Earth for further analysis.

— HSI is an advanced imaging technique which combines photography and spectroscopy. HSI captures/collects data from the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum. Pixxel's Firefly HSI satellites can capture 150+ spectral bands of light, this means they can be used to detect even the slightest changes in chemical compositions, vegetation health, water quality, and atmosphere with great accuracy.

— With a 5-meter resolution and a 40-km swath width, Pixxel claims that their satellites provide the highest resolution in the HSI category and outperform any other competitors in the same category.

— It is one thing to launch the satellites and collect data, but processing HSI data has its own challenges. When we are talking about collecting data from hundreds of bands, we are talking about dealing with n-dimensional spatial and spectral data. Pixxel is building its own data processing software known as Aurora for that purpose.

— Instead of depending on third-party HSI processing software, Pixxel designed and built Aurora from ground up. It is currently accessible to the public for a trial period, served with images from their first mission Shakuntala (named after math whiz Shakuntala Devi).

— As one of the six recipients of the US's National Reconnaissance Office grant to explore the utility of HSI for world-class intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance purposes, Pixxel is currently in talks with the US government and India for defense use cases. With 65 clients such as Rio Tinto, British Petroleum, and India's Ministry of Agriculture, Pixxel is eyeing up to $1B market share by 2029.
