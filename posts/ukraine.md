The on-going war between Russia and Ukraine is now a test bed for the latest military-tech companies. This war influenced the Baltic region so much that tech startups are pivoting themselves to meet the demand. There are over 100 drone startups in Ukraine alone. War-torn Kyiv earned the name "Mil-tech Valley." Here's more on it:

— A massive culture shift allowed ingestion of so much technology so fast. At 32 years of age, Mykhailo Fedorov, a former digital marketing entrepreneur, leads Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation, who is running the war like a startup.

— In April 2023, the government-led BRAVE1 mil-tech cluster was launched to support start-ups working on defense-tech projects in Ukraine. It's located in Kyiv, with all the hipster-esque facilities such as beanbags, coffee stands, and trampolines.

— A military startup accelerator known as D3 (Dare to Defend Democracy) has attracted high-profile foreign investors, such as Google's ex-CEO Eric Schmidt, who has invested millions into it.

— European defense tech raised nearly $1B in 2023 alone. Latvian government announced a €600K prize fund for drone startups and a €10M budget for drone program. NATO released €1B for dual-use startups. The EU committed €7B for R&D thru' 2027.
 
— Ukraine applied every single available defense-tech out there for its war effort: Palantir for analyzing battlefield data, Anduril's autonomous drones for surveillance and recon operations, USAF's Ghost kamikaze drones, land-drones for laying anti-tank mines, and FPV drones to drop large payloads on tanks.

— In addition to this, Ukraine's EW (electronic warfare) includes a domestically developed Anti-Drone Jammer device known as EDM4S, wearable drone detectors, specialized signal detectors, and DELTA - a situationally aware battlefield management system nicknamed "Google for military" for its ability to organize war space.

— Civilians contributed to this war too: Ukraine's military Discord is still active. In early 2022, an air-alert app was developed to announce air raids in Luke Skywalker's voice, and hardware-nerds formed an active "Military Signalmen" group on Signal(messaging app) to provide tech-support to military personnel. Money was raised on crytpo platforms.

— War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse [§]. None of this is to support war mongering or the industrial military complex. I just find the technology and collaboration (between civilians, military, and industry) pretty amazing.

§. That line is from a show called M.A.S.H. Yours truly did not watch that show but ID's with that line's sentiment.
