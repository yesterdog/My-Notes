Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV for short) is a technique used to etch circuits on wafers. EUV is what makes Nvidia's latest and fastest Blackwell (4nm) chips possible, and the technology behind it is produced by a relatively unknown Dutch company called ASML. ASML's EUV is one of the most safeguarded technologies in the entire Western hemisphere. EUV is a modern marvel, a technology whose mere existence is baffling. Here's more about ASML's EUV:

— The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) is a trade consortium made up of experts working in semiconductors to develop roadmaps for the next generations of semiconductor technology. They analyze industry trends, such as customer needs, to predict the MOSFET scaling required for future chips and work towards building them. This consortium includes members from otherwise competing industries.

— Lithography works by shooting a high-powered laser beam onto a silicon wafer to etch circuits. For a long time, deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) technology was used to print layers on chips, until EUV was introduced.

— EUV uses 13.5nm wavelength light as opposed to DUV's 193nm. While EUV uses mirrors to transfer light beams, DUV uses lenses. Given that DUV has been pushed to its limits and with compute-demands growing for smaller process nodes on chips, the semiconductor industry started placing its bets on EUV.

— The 13.5nm wavelength offers maximum spectral efficiency. To achieve this goal, several innovations came together in optics for maximum reflection, as traditional lenses would absorb the light, and advancements in material science to increase the intensity of a single beam to produce the required wattage. Unlike trial and error, the requirements were drafted and things were worked backwards to accomplish them.

— Zeiss manufactures the mirrors required for reflection. These mirrors are polished to a smoothness of less than one atom's thickness. To put this in perspective, if the mirrors were the size of Germany, the tallest "mountain" would be just 1 millimeter high.

— Tin droplets thinner than a human hair are released at 288 km/h and are shot by a CO2 laser multiple times at precise angles. This results in ionic changes that bring tin to a plasma state, at which point the required 13.5nm light is emitted and reflected via mirrros to etch very intricate circuits. Any aberration in the laser's hitting angle could destroy the mirrors, which take several years to produce.

— Mirrors direct the 13.5nm light to the wafer by passing it through a photomask that contains the intricate patterns of the microchip design. The light source etches the patterns onto the wafer. Additional techniques are used to remove any impurities, and this process is repeated for several layers. The end result is a wafer with millions of structures at the nanometer scale. The latest EUV machines can produce 185 wafers per hour, and ASML has promised to increase this to 220 in the newer machines.

— Each machine costs upwards of $150M–$200M USD, with the latest ones expected to cost about $300M–$400M USD. Transporting these machines requires 250 crates across 43 freight containers, utilizing multiple cargo planes. Each machine weighs 165 tons and takes six months to install. This technology is so important that it is not sold to China, and it is said there is a "kill switch" in the EUV machines sold to Taiwan's TSMC, in case the country is invaded by China.

— EUV's invention is a feat whose scale belongs to the same class as moon-landing or Egyptian pyramids or Gothic Cathedrals or cuneiforms. In other words, "here are cathedrals everywhere for those with eyes to see".
