Concorde last flew in the skies in November 2003. Two decades since, commercial
supersonic travel seemed like a dream from a bygone area. But, Boom is about to change that with 
their Overture Supersonic plane when it becomes production ready. Boom's demonstrator aircraft XB-1 finished its transsonic flight at 0.95 mach, this is 20% faster than the fastest commercial planes today. 

— Boom's is an independent manufacturer, meaning they design and develop their own supersonic aircraft, the Overture, without relying on another primary aerospace company. 

— Boom designed and  built a lot of things from ground up: force-feedback sidesticks-a first time for an airline, autoland and augmented reality glasses to help pilots land the planes safely.

— Every airplane function is accessible via high definition touch screen while physical controls such as stick, throttle, and landing gear—are offered for safety critical functions.

—  Overture will receive OTA software upgrades, meaning new features and improvements will arrive regularly. Airlines can control how upgrades are rolled out across fleets.

— Unlike Concorde, Boom's Overture is designed: to fly on SAF fuel and adhere to strict regulatory noise levels as the latest commercial planes. This is made possible because of Boom's proprietary Symphony engine.

— Overture is designed to fly 4,250 miles non-stop and fly at an altitude to 60,000 feet...way above commercial aircraft(30k-40k feet), they are high enough to see the curvature of the earth below.

— Boom is ready to test XB-1 in supersonic speeds in 2025 reaching at least Mach 1.
