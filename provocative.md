provocative ideas

I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going


In the early 1950's the computer,the SoTA machine was a vaccum tube Whirlpool system.
The notion of software as a separate entity from the computer was not fully realised.
Time sharing of the computer was not invented. 

~Decade before that Alan Mathius Turing proposed
mahine intelligence, which at the time was not a promising research area to venture into despite
the gradoise ambitions. The smartest people at that time did not think , it was pragmatic.~

Marvin Minsky who goes on invent the first neural network and James McCarthy who goes on to invent
timesharing and Lisp(world's first functional programming language) to create artificial intelligence 
uisng symbolic logic. when they proposed formal symbolic language or possibilites to build artificial
intelligence, they were scoffed at.They ware called charlatans.The fellows although not world famous
at the time, were PhD's at Dartmouth and MIT.

It is not the first time anyone was made fun suggesting a provocative idea. The seemingly impossible
thing to achieve. Regardless of the possibility of it happening and at the cost of being made fun of 
, we should develop and propose provcative ideas. Even if something is not generally acknowledged as doable,
 in Pascal’s Mugging sort of logic way–i.e, there are other benefits that happen while trying to explore the main thing.

 Nothing could be as provocative as going to moon. On top of putting a human on the moon, several other technologies 
 came to be due to exploring the idea of going to the moon.

 It is equally possible that someone might end up with dr.x's fate, for suggesting people to wash their hands before 
 the surgery. It is for this reason, find a buddy who shares your optimisim to propose and tryout provocative ideas. If you can't find someone to agree with you on a provocative idea of your's try to find someone who is willing to listen to you. 
not provocative ideas
leaving a job to travel alone to invent is not a provocative idea i am talking here. i am referring to ideas that stir fire,
that will make you go un-exhauseted, that might let other people scoff at you, soemthiing that you are willing to wager
everything you have just for the sake of it.

why is provocative thinking not possible:
- weird, social cicumstanc
es of the western institutes are great
- stripe on why it can be founded in Ireland
- not knowing the subject; if there is a single most influential document that influenced teh compters we know today, it
is human-computer symbiosis

newoton:
all three ideas are equally provocative, only one worked/
in that sense, it is okay to engage in multiple provocative ideas one of them will stick.
no this is not necessarily bruteforcing(although is not bad, when looked as perseverance), it is just that some ideas work
and some don't
